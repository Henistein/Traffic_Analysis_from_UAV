TPH-YOLOv5
- Aims to improve the performance of object detection on drone-captures images.
- It uses self attention mechanism
- It replaces the original prediction heads with Transformer Prediction Heads (TPH)
- Integrates convolutional block attention model (CBAM) to find attention region on scenarios with dense objets.
- It was tested using Visdrone Dataset
- Cite the results got from DET challenge.

- Explain the TPH
- Explain the CBAM
