The main idea of YOLO is shown in Figure X. According to the paper, this model divides the input image into an SxS grid and if the center of an object is inside a grid cell, that grid cell will be responsible for detecting the object. Each cell predicts B bounding boxes and their confidence level, that lies between 0 and 1. This confidence scores are defined as Pr(Object)*IOU(truth pred): Pr(Object) indicates the probability of existing objects.  (IOU tp) it is a confidence that represents the Intersection Over Union between the predicted and the ground truth box. IOU is simply calculated through the division between the intersection area of the predicted and ground truth box by the union of the same boxes. Each grid cell also predicts C conditional class probabilities, Pr(Classi|object), these are conditioned on the grid cell containing an object.
